Week 5

Notes: 
The problems with the Papyrus software continue, and we are still trying to solve them. We are testing AppsAnywhere as an alternative to the desktop Papyrus app.
Task 3 has been completed except for some minor adjustments from all team members.
This week, we will start working on Task 4 and the team report.
